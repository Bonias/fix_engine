Fix Engine is a (minimalistic) implementation of the Financial Information eXchange with client-server multithread workarounds.
It based on pr-fix: https://github.com/uritu/pr-fix, by Joseph Dunn <joseph@magnesium.net>.

Common sub-library:
 * system_processor - special class that regulate server workaround.
 * tcp_client - class that works with tcp socket, protect it from different exceptions, and made read method separated from main thread.
 * tcp_server - class that separate accept and connected clients read threads to separate threads (so main program could process them asynchronius).
 * timer - class that do some action with user defined sleep_intervale

Fix sub-library:
 * message - class generates fix_message
 * response - class that created for processing fix_message
 * session - class that define session defines for fix messages
